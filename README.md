# Toggle Password Visibility

A script that lets users toggle the visibility of password fields.

My first project as part of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com/) ðŸ˜Š

## Part 1

Allow users to toggle a single password field.

## Part 2

Refactor the project to allow users to toggle multiple password fields at once.

## Part 3

Refactor the project again to allow users to toggle multiple password fields at once **across multiple forms**.
